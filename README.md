</p>

## Install:
Clone the repo, go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, then load this as an unpacked extension.

## Features:
1. Hide messages from any User
2. Hide messages from any bot
3. Optionally allow messages to be hidden only from DMs

## How To Use:
1. Click on the extension icon or navigate to extension options.
2. Enter the `ID` of the user/bot you want to block. **NOTE:** This ID is not the slack handle the user/bot has, but the unique ID that slack assigns to every User/Bot. 
3. You can get the ID by viewing a member's profile and clicking the down arrow then "Copy member ID"
4. You can block multiple users or bots by specifying their User IDs separated by `,`.
5. Make sure you want to make Slack a happy place again.
6. Save!
