Install Happy Slack! from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/happy-slack-hide-messages/mjingehmnkofkklkdlipioiinepjghlo).

## How To Use:
1. Click on the extension icon or navigate to extension options.
2. Enter the `User ID` of the user you want to block. **NOTE:** This User ID is not the slack handle the user has, but the unique ID that slack assigns to every User. 
3. You can get the User ID by **right clicking on the user's name under the Direct Messages List** on the left, and **selecting `Inspect`**. From there, look for the property **`data-member-id`**. That is the User ID we are looking for.
4. You can block multiple users by specifying their User IDs separated by `,`.
5. Make sure you want to make Slack a happy place again.
6. Save!

1. Hide messages from useless people who only talk rubbish
2. Try to get over your workplace crush by pretending she doesn't exist
3. Do the same^ for your workplace ex :sob:
